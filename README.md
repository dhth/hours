# hours

`hours` is a no-frills time tracking toolkit for the command line.

It's designed for users who want basic time tracking for their tasks/projects
right in the terminal. With a simple and minimalistic UI, almost everything in
`hours` can be achieved with one or two keypresses. It can also generate
plaintext reports, summary statistics, and logs based on time tracked.

🤔 Motivation
---

For a while, I've been wanting to keep track of time I spend on side projects
and other non-day-job activities. I also wanted to be able to generate plain
text reports to get an overview of time allocation. All of this needed to be
done via a fast command line tool that prioritised ease of use over
fancy-but-ultimately-not-so-useful features. I couldn't find a tool that
precisely fit these needs, so I decided to build one for myself.

### TUI

Open the TUI by simply running `hours`. The TUI lets you do the following:

- create/update tasks
- start/stop tracking time on a task
- add manual task log entries
- deactivate/activate a task
- view historical task log entries

Besides a TUI, `hours` also offers reports, statistics, and logs based on the
time tracking you do. These can be viewed using the subcommands `report`,
`stats`, and `log` respectively.

### Reports

```bash
hours report [flags] [arg]
```

Output a report based on task log entries.

Reports show time spent on tasks per day in the time period you specify. These
can also be aggregated (using `-a`) to consolidate all task entries and show the
cumulative time spent on each task per day.

Accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

    today:     for today's report
    yest:      for yesterday's report
    3d:        for a report on the last 3 days (default)
    week:      for a report on the current week
    date:      for a report for a specific date (eg. "2024/06/08")
    range:     for a report for a date range (eg. "2024/06/08...2024/06/12")

*Note: If a task log continues past midnight in your local timezone, it will be
reported on the day it ends.*

### Logs

```bash
hours log [flags] [arg]
```

Output task log entries.

Accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

    today:     for log entries from today
    yest:      for log entries from yesterday
    3d:        for log entries from the last 3 days (default)
    week:      for log entries from the current week
    date:      for log entries from a specific date (eg. "2024/06/08")
    range:     for log entries from a specific date range (eg. "2024/06/08...2024/06/12")

*Note: If a task log continues past midnight in your local timezone, it'll
appear in the log for the day it ends.*

Statistics
---

```bash
hours stats [flag] [arg]
```

Output statistics for tracked time.

Accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

    today:     show stats for today
    yest:      show stats for yesterday
    3d:        show stats for the last 3 days (default)
    week:      show stats for the current week
    month:     show stats for the current month
    date:      show stats for a specific date (eg. "2024/06/08")
    range:     show stats for a specific date range (eg. "2024/06/08...2024/06/12")
    all:       show stats for all log entries

*Note: If a task log continues past midnight in your local timezone, it'll
be considered in the stats for the day it ends.*
