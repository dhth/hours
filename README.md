`hours` is a no-frills time tracking toolkit for the command line.

It's designed for users who want basic time tracking for their tasks/projects
right in the terminal. With a simple and minimalistic UI, almost everything in
`hours` can be achieved with one or two keypresses. It can also generate
plaintext reports, summary statistics, and logs based on time tracked.

🤔 Motivation
---

For a while, I've been wanting to keep track of time I spend on side projects
and other non-day-job activities. I also wanted to be able to generate plain
text reports to get an overview of time allocation. All of this needed to be
done via a fast command line tool that prioritised ease of use over
fancy-but-ultimately-not-so-useful features. I couldn't find a tool that
precisely fit these needs, so I decided to build one for myself.

💾 Install
---

**homebrew**:

```sh
brew install dhth/tap/hours
```

**go**:

```sh
go install github.com/dhth/hours@latest
```

Or get the binaries directly from a
[release](https://github.com/dhth/hours/releases).

⚡️ Usage
---

> Newbie tip: If you want to see how `hours` works without having to track time,
> you can have it generate dummy data for you. See [here](#generate-dummy-data)
> for more details.

### TUI

Open the TUI by simply running `hours`. The TUI lets you do the following:

- create/update tasks
- start/stop tracking time on a task
- add manual task log entries
- edit task logs
- view task log details
- deactivate/activate a task
- view historical task log entries

![Usage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d804cc05-53d0-4740-ac53-6f8bf636be6c)

Besides a TUI, `hours` also offers reports, statistics, and logs based on the
time tracking you do. These can be viewed using the subcommands `report`,
`stats`, and `log` respectively.

### Reports

```bash
hours report [flags] [arg]
```

Output a report based on task log entries.

Reports show time spent on tasks per day in the time period you specify. These
can also be aggregated (using `-a`) to consolidate all task entries and show the
cumulative time spent on each task per day.

Accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

    today:     for today's report
    yest:      for yesterday's report
    3d:        for a report on the last 3 days (default)
    week:      for a report on the current week
    date:      for a report for a specific date (eg. "2024/06/08")
    range:     for a report for a date range (eg. "2024/06/08...2024/06/12")

*Note: If a task log continues past midnight in your local timezone, it will be
reported on the day it ends.*

![Usage](https://tools.dhruvs.space/images/hours/report-1.png)

Reports can also be viewed via an interactive interface using the
`--interactive`/`-i` flag.

### Log

```bash
hours log [flags] [arg]
```

Output task log entries.

Accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

    today:     for log entries from today (default)
    yest:      for log entries from yesterday
    3d:        for log entries from the last 3 days
    week:      for log entries from the current week
    date:      for log entries from a specific date (eg. "2024/06/08")
    range:     for log entries from a specific date range (eg. "2024/06/08...2024/06/12")

*Note: If a task log continues past midnight in your local timezone, it'll
appear in the log for the day it ends.*

![Usage](https://tools.dhruvs.space/images/hours/log-1.png)

Logs can also be viewed via an interactive interface using the
`--interactive`/`-i` flag.

### Statistics

```bash
hours stats [flag] [arg]
```

Output statistics for tracked time.

Accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

    today:     show stats for today
    yest:      show stats for yesterday
    3d:        show stats for the last 3 days (default)
    week:      show stats for the current week
    date:      show stats for a specific date (eg. "2024/06/08")
    range:     show stats for a specific date range (eg. "2024/06/08...2024/06/12")
    all:       show stats for all log entries

*Note: If a task log continues past midnight in your local timezone, it'll
be considered in the stats for the day it ends.*

![Usage](https://tools.dhruvs.space/images/hours/stats-1.png)

Stats can also be viewed via an interactive interface using the
`--interactive`/`-i` flag.

### Active Task

`hours` can show you the task being actively tracked using the `active`
subcommand. This subcommand supports the following placeholders using the
`--template`/`-t` flag:

    {{task}}:  for the task summary
    {{time}}:  for the time spent so far on the active log entry

Tip: This can be used to display the active task in tmux's (or similar terminal
multiplexers) status line using:

```
set -g status-right "#(hours active -t ' {{task}} ({{time}}) ')".
```

### Generate Dummy Data

You can have `hours` generate dummy data for you, so you can play around with
it, and see if its approach of showing reports/logs/stats works for you. You can
do so using the `gen` subcommand.

```bash
hours gen --dbpath=/var/tmp/throwaway.db
```

🎨 Custom Themes
---

`hours` supports custom themes for its user interface (for the TUI and the
output of the `logs`, `report`, and `stats` commands. New themes can be added
using `hours themes add`, which will create a JSON file in `hours`' config
directory. You can then tweak this file as per your liking.

A sample theme config looks like the following. Colors codes can be provided in
ANSI 16, ANSI 256, or HEX formats. You can choose to provide only the attributes
you want to change.

  "toolName": "#fe8019",                     # color for the tool name in the footer
  "tracking": "#fabd2f"                      # color for the tracking message in the footer
}
```

You can view configured themes using `hours themes list`.

Running hours with the `--theme <THEME_NAME>` flag will load up that theme.
Alternatively, you can set `$HOURS_THEME` to the theme name so you don't have to
pass the flag every time.
