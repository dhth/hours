# hours

`hours` is a no-frills time tracking toolkit for the command line.

It's designed for users who want basic time tracking for their tasks/projects
right in the terminal. With a simple and minimalistic UI, almost everything in
`hours` can be achieved with one or two keypresses. It can also generate
plaintext reports, summary statistics, and logs based on time tracked.

🤔 Motivation
---

For a while, I've been wanting to keep track of time I spend on side projects
and other non-day-job activities. I also wanted to be able to generate plain
text reports to get an overview of time allocation. All of this needed to be
done via a fast command line tool that prioritised ease of use over
fancy-but-ultimately-not-so-useful features. I couldn't find a tool that
precisely fit these needs, so I decided to build one for myself.

> Newbie tip: If you want to see how `hours` works without having to track time,
> you can have it generate dummy data for you. See [here](#generate-dummy-data)
> for more details.

### TUI

Open the TUI by simply running `hours`. The TUI lets you do the following:

- create/update tasks
- start/stop tracking time on a task
- add manual task log entries
- deactivate/activate a task
- view historical task log entries

![Usage](https://tools.dhruvs.space/images/hours/tui-3.png)

Besides a TUI, `hours` also offers reports, statistics, and logs based on the
time tracking you do. These can be viewed using the subcommands `report`,
`stats`, and `log` respectively.

### Reports

```bash
hours report [flags] [arg]
```

Output a report based on task log entries.

Reports show time spent on tasks per day in the time period you specify. These
can also be aggregated (using `-a`) to consolidate all task entries and show the
cumulative time spent on each task per day.

Accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

    today:     for today's report
    yest:      for yesterday's report
    3d:        for a report on the last 3 days (default)
    week:      for a report on the current week
    date:      for a report for a specific date (eg. "2024/06/08")
    range:     for a report for a date range (eg. "2024/06/08...2024/06/12")

*Note: If a task log continues past midnight in your local timezone, it will be
reported on the day it ends.*

Reports can also be viewed via an interactive interface using the
`--interactive`/`-i` flag.

### Log

```bash
hours log [flags] [arg]
```

Output task log entries.

Accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

    today:     for log entries from today (default)
    yest:      for log entries from yesterday
    3d:        for log entries from the last 3 days
    week:      for log entries from the current week
    date:      for log entries from a specific date (eg. "2024/06/08")
    range:     for log entries from a specific date range (eg. "2024/06/08...2024/06/12")

*Note: If a task log continues past midnight in your local timezone, it'll
appear in the log for the day it ends.*

Logs can also be viewed via an interactive interface using the
`--interactive`/`-i` flag.

### Statistics

```bash
hours stats [flag] [arg]
```

Output statistics for tracked time.

Accepts an argument, which can be one of the following:

    today:     show stats for today
    yest:      show stats for yesterday
    3d:        show stats for the last 3 days (default)
    week:      show stats for the current week
    date:      show stats for a specific date (eg. "2024/06/08")
    range:     show stats for a specific date range (eg. "2024/06/08...2024/06/12")
    all:       show stats for all log entries

*Note: If a task log continues past midnight in your local timezone, it'll
be considered in the stats for the day it ends.*

![Usage](https://tools.dhruvs.space/images/hours/stats-1.png)

Stats can also be viewed via an interactive interface using the
`--interactive`/`-i` flag.

### Active Task

`hours` can show you the task being actively tracked using the `active`
subcommand. This subcommand supports the following placeholders using the
`--template`/`-t` flag:

    {{task}}:  for the task summary
    {{time}}:  for the time spent so far on the active log entry

Tip: This can be used to display the active task in tmux's (or similar terminal
multiplexers) status line using:

```
set -g status-right "#(hours active -t ' {{task}} ({{time}}) ')".
```

### Generate Dummy Data

You can have `hours` generate dummy data for you, so you can play around with
it, and see if its approach of showing reports/logs/stats works for you. You can
do so using the `gen` subcommand.

```bash
hours gen --dbpath=/var/tmp/throwaway.db
```
